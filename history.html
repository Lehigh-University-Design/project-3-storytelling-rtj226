            <p>Great Britain officially controlled the nation of Myanmar in January 1, 1886, following the separation of women's Burma from British India. Burma became the first Anglo-Burmese War, began on 5 March 1824, and has occupied the coastal strip from Chittagong (present-day Bangladesh) to Martaban (now Myanmar). Great Britain claimed the entire nation as a British colony. Recognition as a colony was permitted by the colonial rule of the Burma Railway, also known as the "Death Railway" The railway was built during World War II, connecting Bangkok, Thailand, with Rangoon (now Yangon), Burma. The railway stretched approximately 400 kilometers. The project began by 25,000 Commonwealth Prisoners of War, predominantly Australian soldiers and 80,000 to 100,000 civilians laborers, many of whom were brought forcibly and subjected to brutal circumstances.</p>

            <p>Following British Columbia over Myanmar the June 1945 in WWII was set to be a year, the country went to them but has experienced the British rule for over century. These features were fueled by nationalist desire for self-governance, leading to a call for independence. The journey to political agency was a powerful struggle, as Myanmar had been subjected to coloniza-tion by the British Empire, with all rights stripped, a sense of identity and dignity strived. The growth of national political awareness and the eventual attainment of a sovereign nation-hood brought the determination that Myanmar people had towards their freedom. So Myanmar's journey to independence, which is celebrated annually today, 4th of January.</p>

        <div class="section-content">
            <p>On March 2, 1962, the Burmese military, led by General Ne Win, seized power in a coup d'état, marking the start of military rule that would last nearly five decades. The coup ended the country's brief experiment with parliamentary democracy. Ne Win established the Revolutionary Council and implemented the "Burmese Way to Socialism," which nationalized industries and isolated the nation from the international community. This political shift led to economic stagnation, widespread poverty, and severe restrictions on civil liberties. The military's grip on power would shape Myanmar's political landscape for generations, leading to decades of authoritarian rule and setting the stage for future conflicts.</p>

            <p>In 1988, widespread pro-democracy protests erupted across Myanmar, known as the 8888 Uprising, named after the date August 8, 1988. Students, monks, and citizens took to the streets demanding an end to military rule and the establishment of democratic governance. The protests were met with brutal military crackdowns, resulting in thousands of deaths.</p>
            <p>During this period, Aung San Suu Kyi emerged as a prominent opposition leader, advocating for democracy and human rights. Her activism led to her placement under house arrest, where she remained for much of the next two decades.</p>
            <p>The 1988 uprising marked a turning point in Myanmar's struggle for democracy, inspiring future generations of activists and setting the stage for continued resistance against military rule.</p>

        <div class="section-content">
            <p>In November 2015, Myanmar held its first openly contested general election in 25 years. Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won a landslide victory, securing a majority in both houses of parliament. This historic election marked a significant step toward civilian rule after decades of military dictatorship.</p>
            <p>Despite constitutional restrictions preventing her from becoming president, Aung San Suu Kyi assumed the role of State Counsellor in 2016, effectively becoming the country's de facto leader. The transition brought hope for democratic reforms and improved international relations.</p>
            <p>However, the military retained significant power through constitutional provisions, controlling key ministries and maintaining autonomy over security matters, foreshadowing future tensions.</p>

            <p>In November 2020, Myanmar held general elections in which the NLD again secured a decisive victory. The party won 396 out of 476 seats in parliament, demonstrating continued public support for democratic governance.</p>
            <p>The military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) suffered significant losses. Shortly after, the military began alleging widespread electoral fraud without providing substantial evidence, setting the stage for the crisis to come.</p>
            <p>Tensions escalated as the military refused to accept the election results, despite domestic and international observers affirming the election's credibility. This dispute would culminate in dramatic events in early 2021.</p>

            <p>On February 1, 2021, the Myanmar military staged a coup d'état, detaining Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint, and other NLD leaders. The military declared a one-year state of emergency and handed power to Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing.</p>
            <p>The coup sparked immediate and widespread protests across the country. Citizens organized the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM), with public servants, healthcare workers, teachers, and ordinary citizens refusing to cooperate with the military government.</p>
            <p>The military responded with increasingly violent crackdowns. Security forces used live ammunition against peaceful protesters, resulting in hundreds of deaths and thousands of arrests. Internet blackouts and media restrictions were imposed to suppress information flow.</p>
            <p>Armed resistance groups emerged, including People's Defense Forces (PDF), as protesters realized peaceful demonstrations alone would not restore democracy. The country descended into a state of civil conflict that continues to affect millions of lives.</p>

            <p>The international community has imposed sanctions on military leaders and called for a return to democracy, but the junta maintains its grip on power. Aung San Suu Kyi and other political leaders remain imprisoned under various charges.</p>
            <p>Despite severe repression, resistance continues through both armed struggle and civil disobedience. The people of Myanmar continue their fight for democracy, freedom, and human rights, refusing to accept military dictatorship.</p>
            <p>The crisis has created a refugee emergency, with hundreds of thousands fleeing to neighboring countries. Inside Myanmar, millions face food insecurity, lack of healthcare, disrupted education, and daily fear for their safety.</p>
