          <p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Many young Burmese</span> have 
            taken drastic measures to resist the military’s conscription order. Kan Htoo Lwin, a 20-year-old from Myanmar’s commercial hub, Yangon, was conscripted and trained for three months along with 30 others. The training was grueling, and they were threatened that if anyone tried to escape, their homes would be burned.</p>

          <p>During a journey to the frontline in the eastern part of the country, Kan Htoo saw a chance to escape with two others when their convoy stopped halfway. At some point, they were exhausted and stopped to rest, taking turns sleeping and keeping watch.
            <br>At dawn, the three young men hitched a ride from a truck driver and made it to Aung Ban, a township in southern Shan state. Here, Kan Htoo joined a PDF — one of the many resistance groups growing as more young people, disillusioned with the military junta, take up arms. Two of his companions are currently in hiding. For safety reasons, Kan Htoo doesn’t want to reveal what they are doing now.
