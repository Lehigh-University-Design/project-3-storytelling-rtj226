          <p>The Tatmadaw — Myanmar’s military — claims a standing force of up to half a million men. It is often portrayed as a machine-like army of warriors bred to kill. Since toppling the country’s civilian leadership in early 2021, the junta has only deepened that reputation, crushing dissent with brutal force.
            According to monitoring groups, more than 420 people have been killed, and thousands more assaulted, detained, or tortured since the coup. On one day alone — the deadliest since February 1 — security forces killed more than 100 people, including seven children.
            Amid this violence, cracks have begun to appear within the ranks. In-depth interviews with several officers, including deserters, reveal a more complicated picture of the Tatmadaw — one built on indoctrination, fear, and misplaced loyalty. From the moment they enter boot camp, soldiers are taught that they are the guardians of the nation and of Buddhism itself — that without them, Myanmar would collapse.</p>

          <p>In early March, he bent over the hot pavement in Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city, and picked up spent bullet casings. Nausea crept into his throat. The shells, he knew, meant that real bullets had been fired at real people.
            That night, he logged onto Facebook and discovered what he feared: civilians had been killed by soldiers of the Tatmadaw — men in uniform just like him.
            Days later, the captain, who served with the 77th Light Infantry Division — notorious for massacres of civilians across the country — slipped off base and deserted. He is now in hiding.
            “I love the military so much,” he said. “But the message I want to give my fellow soldiers is: If you are choosing between the country and the Tatmadaw, please choose the country.”
