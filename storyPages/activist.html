          <p><span style="font-weight: 700;">I currently hold a position</span> within the National Unity Government, a revolutionary government actively opposing the military regime. While some may refer to us as an exiled government, this isn't entirely accurate. We control approximately 65% of the territory, have established our own army, and formed strong alliances with various ethnic resistance groups.
            Currently, I am based along the Thai-Myanmar border, while many of our forces are stationed throughout the country. Our acting President, Prime Minister, Minister of Defense, and Minister of Home Affairs are all within Myanmar, actively leading the movement on the ground.
            Before the coup, I was an educator and activist, working to mobilize young people and raise awareness about the importance of human dignity, rights, and democracy. When the coup happened, I couldn’t just step back or run away. It would have been shameful to promote those values and then walk away. So, I chose to stand with the people, committing myself to the fight for democracy and freedom from the regime. After the coup, I initiated strike movements and was one of the first protesters to take to the streets. I helped mobilize others to stand against the regime, fighting for freedom and the restoration of our people's future.</p>

          <p>When the coup happened, I was at my office, and many of my colleagues joined me there. It quickly became a hub for the protests—a place where people would gather, sleep, eat, meet, and plan their demonstrations. However, in March 2021, the military began shooting at protest groups and violently dismantling the movement. Despite being unarmed, we were shot at indiscriminately—men, women, children, and the elderly—often with shots aimed at the head. Faced with this brutal repression, our protest movement had to go underground.
            Since then, the military started to pay attention to our hub and identified me as a key figure mobilizing the movement. They raided my office, but we received a tip-off in advance and managed to escape just in time. Anticipating their arrival, we also informed our parents and family members to move to safe locations. In early October, the military came to my house looking for me. When they found no one there, they set the house on fire.
            <br>
            Our future is filled with uncertainty and hardship, and most days are marked by pain. I often find myself questioning whether my heart has grown stronger or simply become numb. Having spent my entire life under a military regime, I have witnessed firsthand how life unfolds in such an oppressive environment. 
            Young people there lack opportunities and dignity; we have only one or two hours of electricity each day, and accessing the internet is prohibitively expensive. This was the reality of our lives under the regime. With this coup, I feel our country has regressed to a primitive state, disconnected from the progress seen in other parts of the world. We cannot return to the way things were before. I am certain that the dictator and the military regime will continue to hold our country back.
            The military is currently in a precarious position. We have cut off all their resources, and public support for them has dwindled significantly. All they have left is their firepower and a contingent of soldiers who lack intelligence. The crucial factor is that people have already decided to break away from the regime, fully aware of the costs involved.
