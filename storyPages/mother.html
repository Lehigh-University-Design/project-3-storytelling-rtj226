          <p><span style="font-weight: 700;">Across Myanmar,</span> conscripted soldiers — often untrained and unprepared — are sent to conflict zones with little support. Their families are frequently left in the dark about their whereabouts.
            Soe Soe Aye, a widow in her 60s, has been waiting for word from her son, who was conscripted six months ago. He had no desire to serve in the military, she says. “[My son] joined the military to feed his mother,” she adds tearfully. “I regret letting him go.”
            <br>
            Since his departure, Soe Soe Aye has struggled with poor health and now depends on her youngest daughter to keep the household afloat. Still, she clings to hope that her son might return.</p>
