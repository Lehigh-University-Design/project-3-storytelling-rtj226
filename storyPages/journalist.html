          <p><span style="font-weight: 700;">It was around 2010</span> when the country started opening up for liberalization from the authoritative military dictatorship. The previous government led by President Thein Sein, a former military general, decided to transition into a “quasi-democracy” as the military regime was trying to transition as part of their existing strategy. At the time, the government started to create some space for freedom of expression, and they started lifting restrictions on journalism and press freedom. In this period of nascent democracy, a lot of print media and journalists emerged. I decided to work as a journalist, as I'm very much interested in politics, peace, and ethnic conflict.
            The last journal that I worked for was called “Unity Journal”. It mostly covered ethnic affairs, peace, and conflict issues. It was the first-ever ethnic minority affairs journal in Myanmar. At the time, we investigated and publicized a story criticizing the Myanmar military. By then, the government was trying to show its willingness to be open to press freedom and democratic reforms, especially to the international community. However, they were not happy with our reporting, so they forced us to shut down the journal. Some of my colleagues were arrested for doing their jobs. That's the time that I left my journalism career.
            Right now, the dynamic has changed. Especially after the military coup, there is no freedom at all. Since the coup, the military has targeted both current and former journalists; this is because journalists have contacts, and one way or another, they have an association with resistance groups, opposition government members, and other human rights and civil society activists. Many journalists tried to escape from these arbitrary arrests, and most are now based in the Thai-Myanmar border areas on the Thai side.

          <p>We understand that the international community, and international governments, have different priorities, like the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. But the situation in Myanmar is also tragic and needs dire assistance from the outside world. Every day, many people are killed, tortured, raped, and their houses are burned down by the military. I do wish the story of what is happening in Myanmar would get more international attention.
            I still have hope even though I might be a little bit optimistic. It might take time to get on the path to a peaceful return to democracy. But I strongly believe that democracy will prevail because I have seen so many courageous people in Myanmar. When I was in Yangon, the capital of Myanmar after the military coup, people on the streets were shouting anti-coup slogans to demonstrate they wanted democracy back.
