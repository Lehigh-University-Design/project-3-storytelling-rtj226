          <p><span style="font-weight: 700;">I'm an educator.</span> I opened schools in Myanmar, and I've been doing that for the past ten years. We have preschools to high schools, and we are trying to offer affordable, quality education.
            Around 2012, a lot of parents had faith in the new government and moved their kids from private schools to public schools. They believed in the new curriculum and the new way of life. They trusted the message of what was going to be taught and felt like their kids were going to be ready for the 21st century. 
            When schools were supposed to reopen after COVID-19 in 2022, the coup happened, and education was in crisis. People began to think that "if everyone chooses not to go to school, we shouldn't go to school either, because the education system will be under the new government”. But if you don't educate, you can't move forward either, in terms of grades or standards. So, we kept opening our schools and now there's a boom in private schools because the public education system has collapsed. In doing that, a lot of parents started to also choose the international curriculum instead of the Myanmar curriculum.

          <p>Since the coup, things have also changed in kids’ behaviors. It starts from home. Parents are frustrated and stressed because of work, the shrinking economy, and increasing hardships. With so much stress and anger, it’s easy for our language to be more violent. Then kids will use the same language. Kids have also become more familiar with guns and have learned to distrust the police. This trickles down into their behavior at school. School is not supposed to represent a government; it’s an institution where you first learn respect and how to work with others, but now a lot of kids feel like it’s okay to be more violent. 
            What I'm trying to do with the schools is primarily to make sure kids become good citizens; this comes before academic excellence. We want to do that with all the research that we have in human development science to learn how, why, and in what conditions people can learn.
            It's not easy to survive in Myanmar, but I want people to know about the kind of resilience people have here and how we are supporting each other in different ways to live, despite what is happening now.
